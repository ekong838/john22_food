Setup Instructions:

Clone or download the repository containing the HTML file and the CSS file (output.css).
Open the HTML file in a text editor or a code editor that supports HTML.
You can preview the website in a web browser.
Note:

The image paths in the code are relative to the HTML file's location. Make sure the images folder (src/imags icon/) is in the same directory as the HTML file when you run the code.
Some text content is currently in Japanese. You can replace it with your desired language.
